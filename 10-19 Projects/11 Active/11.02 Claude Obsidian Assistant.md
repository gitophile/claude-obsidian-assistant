# Claude Obsidian Assistant

A starter Obsidian vault wired for Claude Code, organized with Johnny Decimal. The core feature is the `/obsidian` skill — a Claude Code command that bridges coding sessions to the vault, syncing project state, dev logs, and architecture canvases directly into the note system. Designed as a template meant to be forked and adjusted; everything from the folder structure to the skill phases is meant to be reshaped around how the user actually works.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/gitophile/claude-obsidian-assistant

## Stack

| Layer | Tech | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Vault | Obsidian | Renders all content; canvas, markdown, properties |
| Organization | Johnny Decimal | Numbered folder structure (00-09 through 50-59) |
| AI Integration | Claude Code | Reads/writes vault files directly, runs `/obsidian` skill |
| Query | Dataview | Powers the home dashboard with live note queries |
| Templates | Templater | Dynamic template rendering with JS expressions |
| Styling | CSS Snippets | 5 self-contained themes (base, crt, y2k, runescape, coquette) |
| Version Control | Git | Tracks vault changes, syncs to GitHub via SSH |

Claude Code works directly with Obsidian's file system — no plugins or bridge APIs needed. The vault IS the project.

## Architecture

### Core Systems

`Claude Code Session` -> `/obsidian skill` -> `Vault Files` -> `Obsidian UI`

### How It Fits Together

1. User runs `/obsidian` from any project directory
2. Skill reads cwd, matches to vault project file (or creates one)
3. Analyzes codebase — package.json, git log, directory structure
4. Presents action menu: update info, dev log, key files, canvas, vault map, full sync
5. Writes changes directly to `.md` and `.canvas` files in the vault
6. Obsidian picks up file changes and renders them live

### JD Area Map
`00-09 System` → meta, templates, config
`10-19 Projects` → active project files (11.XX)
`20-29 Writing` → essays, notes, daily journal
`30-39 Knowledge` → resources, reading list
`40-49 Tracking` → finance, routines, to-dos
`50-59 Creative` → drawings, media, experiments

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Root instructions — vault structure, rules, skill overview |
| `claude-code/obsidian-sync.md` | The `/obsidian` skill — all 5 phases defined here |
| `claude-code/canvas-reference.md` | Canvas JSON format spec for building `.canvas` files |
| `claude-code/SETUP.md` | Quick-start guide for new users |
| `00-09 System/00 Meta/00.01 Home.md` | Dataview dashboard — queries active projects, recent notes |
| `00-09 System/00 Meta/00.02 Vault Map.canvas` | Visual map of all JD areas and content nodes |
| `00-09 System/01 Templates/01.01 Project.md` | Gold-standard project file template |
| `.obsidian/snippets/` | 5 CSS theme files, each fully self-contained |

## Dev Log — February 25, 2026

### Project File
- Created this project file (`11.02 Claude Obsidian Assistant.md`) via `/obsidian` skill
- Added `11.02` node to `00.02 Vault Map.canvas`, connected to Projects area

### Architecture Canvas
- Generated file-level architecture canvas (`Claude Obsidian Assistant Architecture.canvas`) — 50 nodes across 11 layers: Entry/Config, Obsidian Config, Plugins, Skill System, Meta, Templates, Projects, Writing, Knowledge, Tracking, CSS Themes
- 14 edges mapping key relationships (skill → canvas-reference, plugins → config, templates → project files, Dataview → project nodes)

## Dev Log — February 23, 2026

### Templates
- Ported 6 templates from Ideaverse vault: Base (Templater), Base (with Collection), Base (with Tags), Base, Book Template, Book Template Backup (01.04–01.09)
- Normalized frontmatter schema across all 9 templates — added `up`, `related`, `created` to Project/Journal/Daily Note; added `tags` to Base variants

### Plugins
- Installed Templater community plugin; `community-plugins.json` updated
- Set Templater folder to `00-09 System/01 Templates` in settings

### Vault Map
- Populated `00.02 Vault Map.canvas` with 7 content nodes — Home, Example Project, Scratch Pad, daily note, Resources, Reading List, To-Dos — each connected to parent JD area

### Infrastructure
- Generated ed25519 SSH key and added to GitHub
- Switched git remote from HTTPS to SSH (`git@github.com:gitophile/claude-obsidian-assistant`)
- Created `30-39 Knowledge/31 Resources/Claude Code Config.canvas` — visual tree of `~/.claude/` directory
